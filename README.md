# Debugging exercise

- **Objective**: Debug this simulation of a bookstore inventory management system.
- **Task**: Identify and fix the bugs in this application. There are 4 total; 3 should be easy to identify, while the fourth will require some nuance.

## Steps to success

- Familiarize yourself with the application's structure and workflow.
- Start with identifying and fixing the obvious bugs through code review and basic testing.
- Use debugging tools extensively (breakpoints, step-through execution, variable inspection) to uncover the subtle bug.

## Debugging strategies

- Break problems into smaller parts for easier management.
- Look out for common coding mistakes (logic errors, incorrect operators, data structure misuse).
- Pay attention to error messages and exceptions for clues.
- Don't hesitate to seek help for fresh perspectives.
